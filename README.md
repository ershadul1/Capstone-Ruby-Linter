# Features

1. Detects indentation issues 
2. Detects trailing space
3. Detects blank lines 
4. Detects redundant spaces
5. Detects if maximum line length is exceeded
6. Detects if the file has a final empty newline

# Good and Bad Practices

## Indentation

> Use at least two spaces per indentation level 

### Good

```
def some_method
  do_something
end
```

### Bad

```
def some_method
do_something
end
```

## Trailing space

> No space should be included at line endings

## Blank lines

> No blank lines should be included in between codes
> But add one blank line after methods 

### Good

```
def some_method
  do_something
end

def other_method
  do_something
end
```

### Bad

```
def some_method
  
  do_something
end
```

## Maximum line length

> No lines should contain more than 70 characters or spaces

### Good

```
print 'First, and foremost - numerous studies have shown that'
print 'humans read much faster vertically and very long lines'
print 'of text impede the reading process.'
```

### Bad

```
print 'First, and foremost - numerous studies have shown that humans read much faster vertically and very long lines of text impede the reading process.'
```

## Redundant spaces

> No more than one space should be included between 'def' and method name

### Good

```
def some_method
  do_something
end

```

### Bad

```
def   some_method
  do_something
end
```

## Final empty new line

> A file should always end with an empty new line

### Good

```
class Game
  some_code
end

```

### Bad

```
class Game
  some_code
end
```

## Requirements
