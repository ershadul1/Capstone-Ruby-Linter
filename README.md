# Features

1. Indentation
2. Trailing spaces
3. Blank lines 
4. Redundant spaces
5. Maximum line length
6. Final empty line

# Good and Bad Practices

## Indentation

> Use two spaces per indentation level 

### Good

```
def some_method
  do_something
end
```

### Bad

```
def some_method
    do_something
end
```

## Trailing Spaces

> No space should be added at line endings.

## Blank Lines

> No blank lines should be included in between codes.
> One blank line can be added after methods.

### Good

```
def some_method
  do_something
end

def other_method
  do_something
end
```

### Bad

```
def some_method
  
  do_something
end
```

## Maximum Line Length

> No lines should contain more than 70 characters or spaces.

### Good

```
print 'First, and foremost - numerous studies have shown that'
print 'humans read much faster vertically and very long lines'
print 'of text impede the reading process.'
```

### Bad

```
print 'First, and foremost - numerous studies have shown that humans read much faster vertically and very long lines of text impede the reading process.'
```

## Redundant Spaces

> No more than one space should be included in between words.

### Good

```
def some_method
  do_something
end

```

### Bad

```
def   some_method
  do_something
end
```

## Final Empty Line

> A file should always end with an empty line.

### Good

```
class Game
  some_code
end

```

### Bad

```
class Game
  some_code
end
```
